# ML_Rock vs. Mine Prediction

This project utilizes Linear Regression to predict whether an object detected in sonar returns is a rock or a mine.

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for building a machine learning model to classify sonar returns as either a rock or a mine. The dataset used here includes features obtained from sonar signals bouncing off different objects in the ocean.

## Methodology

### Tools and Libraries Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

### Dataset
The dataset used for this project comprises sonar signals obtained from various angles. It consists of features such as frequency response data and patterns in the sonar return.

### Model
Linear Regression was chosen as the predictive model for its simplicity and interpretability in understanding the relationship between features and the target variable.

### Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, handling missing values, and feature scaling if required.
2. Model Training: Splitting the dataset, fitting the Linear Regression model, and optimizing parameters.
3. Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
4. Prediction: Making predictions on new data or test set.

## Results

The model achieved an accuracy of `X%` on the test set, showcasing its performance in classifying sonar returns as rocks or mines.

## Contributions
Contributions to improve the model's performance, add new features, or enhance the documentation are welcome! Please fork the repository, create a new branch, make changes, and open a pull request.
